## Getting Started...

To begin we must look at the **Objective:**
 -Defeat the opposing red alliance.
 
 It's really that simple! 
 
 The game has simple mechanics with:
 W - Forwards
 s - Backwards
 a - turning left
 d - turning right
 
 ## Per-match Objective
 To defeat the red alliance, the objective of each match 
 is to collect and score more game pieces than the opponent.
 
 - Collect gamepieces (in the form of cones or cubes) 
   by driving over them with your robot
   pieces can also be collected at the human player station
   indicated by the blue rectangles and the blue human 
   players standing outside the arena.
 - Score gamepieces by driving over one of the three
   score zones available. The zones must be the same 
   alliance as you (blue) indicated by the drivers on 
   the outer rim of the field.
   
 ## Upgrades
 Upgrading your robot helps in each future match you play.
 After finishing a match on either the main menu, or win/lose screen
 you have three options to upgrade:
 
 speed - upgrades how fast your robot moves forward or backwards.
 Steer - upgrades the turning speed of your robot.
 base score - upgrades how much score you gain for each gamepiece.
