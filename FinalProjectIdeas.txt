Game Ideas
-Upgradable bumpers that make the player take less damage (should have a cap on upgrade)
-different drivetrain types
	-swerve (turns by following the users mouse)
	-tank (turns like a car no mouse needed)
-spots on the robot that allow for attatching parts (Idea from spore)
-multiple levels (of games from previous years)
